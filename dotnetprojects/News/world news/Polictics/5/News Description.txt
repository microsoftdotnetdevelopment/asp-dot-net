The Republicans in House Intelligence Committee will ask the FBI to investigate the leaks surrounding Mike Flynn. The leaks have revealed details of sensitive discussions involving key Trump administration officials.
“We are going to be outlining all of our concerns over the last 60 days that appear to all be related, maybe even coordinated in some ways,” committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told Fox News. “I am going to be asking the FBI to do an assessment of this to tell us what’s going on here because we cannot continue to have these leaks as a government.”

The leaks include details from phone calls between President Donald Trump and the leaders of Australia and Mexico. The intelligence community’s investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential campaign. And now leaked conversations between National Security Adviser Mike Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the U.S. But the real story and the one the media will not report is that certain anti-Trump forces within the government broke the law to try to take down President Trump.

The intelligence community captures phone calls of certain foreign nationals living here. Other governments tap our ambassador’s phones – it’s standard operating procedure.
