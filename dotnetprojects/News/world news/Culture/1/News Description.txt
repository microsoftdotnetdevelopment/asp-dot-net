Beacon is a favorite day trip with urbanites who like their rural respites with an artsy edge. The engaging downtown presents an eclectic cluster of shops, where humble hardware stores and old-fashioned diners mingle with SoHo-style galleries and gourmet food shops. It garners international attention as the home to contemporary art mecca DIA. Best of all, it’s just a few minutes stroll from the Metro-North train station, an easy 60-mile from ride from midtown.
The Roundhouse, a boutique hotel inspired by Beacon’s rich artisan legacy and green-thumb food scene, is tempting visitors to spend a night or weekend. If you’re looking for a romantic hideaway close to New York City with post-industrial visual flair, make your reservations.

Once home to a textile factory, the owners of The Roundhouse have strived to keep as much architectural integrity as structurally possible. Historical preservation and a strong sense of place are paramount at this design-centric hotel. Original materials have been repurposed with panache. It’s an aesthetic fantasy for those who appreciate an effort to lean local: light fixtures, tiles, tables and beds are made by talented craftspeople who live and create in the Hudson Valley.
The 41 rooms are situated in two buildings (low-season rates start at $189 per night). The custom-crafted furniture and un-cluttered style may be just the elixir you’re craving after spending your days and nights in cramped city apartments. Do yourself a favor and book a room with a view of Beacon Falls. In my suite, even the bathtub had a direct sightline of the rushing water. Stop by Beacon Bath & Bubble and purchase some of their artfully packaged handmade soaps and bath salts before you hit the water. A farm-fresh breakfast is included with your room, served until a civilized 10 am.
