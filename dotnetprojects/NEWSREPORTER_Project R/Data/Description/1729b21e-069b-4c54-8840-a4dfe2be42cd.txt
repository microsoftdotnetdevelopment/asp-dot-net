The release of filmmaker Prakash Jha’s upcoming production Lipstick Under My Burkha, starring Konkona Sensharma and Ratna Pathak Shah, has hit a roadblock after the censor board refused to certify the film.

Listing the reasons for denial of certificate, Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) in a letter, posted by Bollywood celebrities online, wrote, “The story is lady oriented, their fantasy above life. There are contanious sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society, hence film refused under guidelines (sic).”
The film’s director Alankrita Shrivastava criticised CBFC’s decision saying it is an “assault on women’s rights” and she will fight till the end to get her film released. “I believe the decision to refuse certification to our film is an assault on women’s rights. For too long the popular narrative has perpetuated patriarchy by objectifying women or minimising their role in a narrative. So a film like ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’, that challenges that dominant narrative is being attacked because it presents a female point of view. Do women not have the right of freedom of expression?,” she said in a statement.

The director said she is determined to fight the decision till the end to ensure that Indian audiences watch movie. “The real issue is the systematic suppression of women’s voices and the throttling of freedom of expression.”
