Australia will have their work cut out in their bid to contain Virat Kohli's Team India who are riding high on six series wins.
Top-ranked India are on a brilliant run, unbeaten in 19 Tests over a 16-month period with South Africa, New Zealand, England and Bangladesh all vanquished at home, while trips to Sri Lanka and West Indies also culminated in victories. (Virat Kohli focussed on next target: 'Our minds and hearts on Australia series')
By contrast, the visiting Steve Smith's side were thrashed 3-0 in Sri Lanka and lost the first two Tests of a three-match home series against South Africa before wholesale changes led to a consolation win in Adelaide and the new charges went on to sweep aside Pakistan.
However, Australia's toughest challenge will come when they take on India in the upcoming four-Test series starting February 23. And what makes the contest even more difficult for the Aussies is Kohli - the man who seems to be in the form of his life.
