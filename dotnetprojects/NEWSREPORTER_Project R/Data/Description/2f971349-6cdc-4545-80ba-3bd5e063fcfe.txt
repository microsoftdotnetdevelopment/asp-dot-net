Miranda Lambert called out a subset of supposed fans who flooded a recent Instagram post of hers with negative comments about her relationship with singer-songwriter Anderson East.
After posting a “really personal” photo of herself riding her horse, Leiani, the “Mama’s Broken Heart” singer blasted fans who criticized a photo she posted showing her with East at the 2016 CMA Awards from the night before (November 2).
“Last night I was all dolled up and ‘out on the town’ with my sweet man at the CMA awards in Nashville. I was excited about the night and posted a picture,” she wrote. “Just now when I looked I realized so many comments were judgmental and negative.”
Lambert continued, calling out fans — many of which seem to believe Lambert is still pining over her ex-husband, Blake Shelton, based solely on her body language with East — who left rude comments after analyzing the photo.
