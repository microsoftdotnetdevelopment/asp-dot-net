Instant messaging app WhatsApp is working on a feature that will allow you to track your friends in real time.

According to the WABetaInfo account on Twitter, which is known for leaking information related to WhatsApp, the feature will work on beta version 2.17.3.28 for iOS, 2.16.399+ on Android and will be disabled by default.

“The tracking can be kept on for 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, or indefinitely. This comes in handy if you’re supposed to meet the gang at a certain location and time, and you want to see how far away from the destination every one in the group is,” phonearena.com reported on Monday.

The live streaming can also be disabled, it added.

With 160 million users in India, WhatsApp is available in more than 50 different languages. Nearly 100 million calls are being made on the platform daily worldwide.
