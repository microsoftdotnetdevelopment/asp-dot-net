To add to the ex-Spears-ience, many viewers decided to live-tweet along with the messy interpretation of Brit Brit’s life story. (At one point, “Britney” sends a text message that says “I wnt 2 dvrce U” to “K-Fed,” just so we’re clear on the degree of hilarity. She also has a sad dance battle with “Justin.”)
Some of those Britney Ever After viewers just happened to be major stars, including Buffy The Vampire Slayer — err, Sarah Michelle Gellar. In fact, she was even name-dropped in the movie! (Well, her character was.) And she, uh…was both flattered and horrified at the same time.
“Highest of highs and lowest of lows all in one moment #britneyeverafter #OppositeofOscar,” she tweeted along with a video snippet of her unexpected cameo. “Y’all I think they meant a different #buffy #britneyeverafter.”
Jersey Shore‘s Snooki, a well-documented Holy Spearit stan, also let her feelings be known on Twitter during the course of the evening: “I wonder what Britney thinks of this movie. #britneyeverafter,” she wrote, complete with a Teresa Giudice table flip GIF.
As for RuPaul’s Drag Race winner Alaska, another major Britney stan? She weighed in all night long too…and was equally not having it: “I just want to go to an island somewhere.. where no one knows this movie ever existed… #BritneyEverAfter,” the “Your Makeup Is Terrible” queen wrote.
