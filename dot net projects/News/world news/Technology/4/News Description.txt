You know the drill by now: Facebook is big on video these days, releasing near-constant updates and features to get more eyeballs on moving pictures in the News Feed. 

Today, the social network took it one step further, announcing its biggest move in quite a while: a new Facebook video app for TV. 

With the app, you can watch videos shared from your friends and you follow Pages, tune into live videos and view recommended videos right on your big screen. You can also watch videos you've saved for later, plus rewatch clips you've already seen, shared or uploaded yourself. 

Previously, you could stream videos from Facebook to your TV, but the new app creates a native experience, removing the need for a secondary device and putting Facebook videos directly into your television set.

The new Facebook video app will soon roll out to Apple TV , Amazon Fire TV and Samsung Smart TV, and more platforms will be added down the road, Facebook said in a blog post .
