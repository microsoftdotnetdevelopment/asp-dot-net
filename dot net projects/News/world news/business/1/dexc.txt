Describing North Korea as a "big problem", US President Donald Trump today vowed to deal with it "very strongly", after the reclusive country carried out yet another ballistic missile test. "Not only internationally but when you come right here, we have - obviously, North Korea is a big, big problem, and we will deal with that very strongly," Trump told reporters during a joint news conference with the visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Trump was responding to a question on greatest national security threat based on the intelligence briefings that he has been receiving for about a month now after he was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on January 20.
"Many, many problems," Trump said in response to a question. "When I was campaigning, I said it's not a good situation. Now that I see it including with our intelligence briefings, we have problems that a lot of people have no idea how bad they are, how serious they are," said the US President.
"We have problems all over the Middle East, we have problems just about every corner of the globe no matter where you look," Trump said.
