Wholesale inflation has shot up to a 30-month high of 5.25 per cent in January as rising global crude oil prices spiked domestic fuel cost, even as food prices moderated.

The wholesale price index (WPI) based inflation, reflecting the annual rate of price rise, in December stood at 3.39 per cent.

In January 2016, the print was (—)1.07 per cent.

Oil prices have been on rise since OPEC in early December decided to cut output for the first time in eight years. Spot LNG prices have also risen from $ 5.25 to about $ 9 per MMBTU on winter heating requirements. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is used for power generation.

In its policy last week, RBI retained the benchmark interest rate and changed the stance from ‘accommodative’ to ’neutral’, indicating that there will not be any rate cut in the near term.

It may, however, have to review its policy stance in the wake of retail inflation touching multi—year low in January.

The RBI projected inflation will remain below 5 per cent in the January—March quarter of this fiscal but hardening of global crude oil prices and volatility in exchange rates could put upside pressure in the next financial year.

It said inflation will be in the range of 4—4.5 per cent in the first half and 4.5—5 per cent in the second half of 2017—18.
