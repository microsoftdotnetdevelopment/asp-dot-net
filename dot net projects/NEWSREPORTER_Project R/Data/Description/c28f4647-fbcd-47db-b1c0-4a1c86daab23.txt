Derek Jeter’s pregnant wife, Hannah Davis, had to be rescued by firefighters after she got stuck in an elevator for nearly 30 minutes at a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition event.

Davis, who posed in Mexico for a spread in the magazine just before learning she is expecting a girl with the former Yankees captain, appeared at Thursday’s Manhattan event in a shimmering asymmetrical gown that revealed her small bump.

Sources at the SI party at 415 Fifth Avenue said Davis stayed until the end of the party and left around 10 p.m., taking an elevator down one floor with fellow swimsuit model Hannah Ferguson.

But the elevator jammed, and the two models were trapped inside. One source said, “The party was on the second floor, and Hannah Davis took the elevator down one floor to exit because they didn’t want her to take the stairs because she’s pregnant.

“There was a huge commotion when she and Hannah Ferguson got stuck inside, they were in there for about 30 minutes.

“The fire department was called, and two huge trucks arrived with about 20 firefighters. They came at the elevator with a big hook to get the two models out.”

Finally, the pair was freed, and Davis, apparently, took the incident in stride. The witness added, “While all the party organizers were freaking out, Hannah, when she emerged, was totally calm and thanked the firefighters for coming to her assistance. But I was surprised Hannah didn’t have an escort with her. She came on her own.”

Also at the party were Chrissy Teigen, Christie Brinkley, Alexa Joel and Kate Upton
