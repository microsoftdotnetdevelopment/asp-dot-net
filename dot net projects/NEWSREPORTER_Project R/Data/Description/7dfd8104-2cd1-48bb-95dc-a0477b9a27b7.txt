After a turbulent start to Donald Trump’s presidency, which has seen millions of Americans take to the streets, Republican states are introducing a number of ‘anti-protest’ laws.

Some of the bills were registered before Mr Trump’s inauguration, as a response to mass protests organised by Black Lives Matter and at Standing Rock.

However, the laws have come under fresh scrutiny after mass protests against the Mr Trump administration, including the Women's March, which may have been the largest demonstration in US history. At least 10 new bills which aim to curb the right to protest have been filed by state legislatures in recent months.

In North Dakota, where a protest camp has been established for months on the proposed site of the North Dakota Access pipeline, legislators recently introduced a bill which would allow motorists to run over and kill a protester, so long as the driver did not “intend” to kill them.
